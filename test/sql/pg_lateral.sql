-- pg_orca LATERAL coverage from PostgreSQL upstream
--
-- This is the "Test LATERAL" section of PostgreSQL's join.sql (the test
-- block introduced by the "-- Test LATERAL" header), ported verbatim so we
-- exercise the same shapes the upstream regression suite does. Setup
-- tables (int2_tbl, int4_tbl, int8_tbl, tenk1, onerow) mirror PG's
-- test_setup.sql and the top of join.sql; tenk1 is loaded from the
-- upstream tenk.data file via the PG_REGRESS_SQL search path.
--
-- The point of running this through pg_orca is to catch any LATERAL
-- pattern that crashes / falls back / mis-computes. We don't compare
-- ORCA's plans against PG's (different optimizers) but we do compare
-- result rows.
--
